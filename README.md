# Emojiconomy

🌸🍇🍈🍉🍊🍋

A project for Procjam 2019.

This program uses a graph grammar to generate diagrams of the flow of goods
in a toy economy. Plants are eaten, or processed into food and materials.
Ore is mined, refined, and made into machines.

## Goals

  [ ] Generate a graph with all the components of the economy labelled with emoji.
  [ ] Calculate max-flow given a restricted amount of source capacity.
  [ ] Generate a utility function that rewards consumption of multiple types of goods. (Maybe label some as substitutes or complements in the graph.) Figure out how to calculate a flow that maximizes this utility.
  [ ] Duplicate the economic graph and disable parts of it to generate isolated economies that would benefit from trade.
  [ ] Create trading routes between the economies.
  [ ] Cute web page that animates the result.
